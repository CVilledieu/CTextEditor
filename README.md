# My Text Editor

## Intro to C 

### Details about the text editor
To handle the strings I found the best choice was a Rope(Binary Tree) and hadn't had many chances to use one in a project.
I chose to have an actual GUI instead of simply using the terminal to handle everything. This was mostly so I can use the Win32 API.

### Learning / Understanding Goals:
- Basic C syntax
- How C handles different aspects e.g. Pointers and arrays
- Win32 API
